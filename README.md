Home work 2 
This homework was very challenging! It felt several steps away from the topics we learned in class. 
Working through this task helped me to understand the following concpts better and can be used as a reference for:

calling keys from dictionaries
making lists from items in dictionaries
counting list items
using one list to index items on another list
using "f'" function for printing
skipping a line for printing
printing to text
using Git Hub
